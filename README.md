# Collecting-temperatures-in-the-greenhouse-notification-when-the-temperature-exceeds-a-certain-value

The user has an insight into current and historical measurements of temperatures in the greenhouse via the blynk application interface. It also has the ability to manage notifications by which it is notified when the temperature value from a particular sensor exceeds the set value and thus prevents any damage that would occur if the user was not notified of the event. (Events to be notified: temperature high, temperature too high, temperature low, temperature too low).

Components used: nodemcu (ESP8266), 5x ds18b20 waterproof temperature sensors, power supply, Blynk, 35 m cable.

Sensors are placed at different locations inside and outside the greenhouse. In order to collect data on temperature trends throughout the year and improve the cultivation process.
