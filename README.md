The user has an insight into current and historical measurements of temperatures in the greenhouse via the blynk application interface. It also has the ability to manage notifications by which it is notified when the temperature value from a particular sensor exceeds the set value and thus prevents any damage that would occur if the user was not notified of the event. (Events to be notified: temperature high, temperature too high, temperature low, temperature too low).
